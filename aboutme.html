	<h1>Personal Details</h1>
		<p class="flex">
			<img src="IMG/profilepicture.PNG"> Hi. I'm Nelson Chhorn, a 14 year-old boy born in Australia in 2006 with a Cambodian background. I spent my years from Kindergarten to Year 6 at Villawood North Public School in Villawood. After primary school, I have made my way to Hurlstone Agricultural High School, where I have been attending since I was in Year 7 in 2019. While I may have naively enjoyed school more than I should have before, I have no come to witness the shortcomings and stressfulness behind going to school. However now I have reformed and am enjoying school more now. Including me, I come from a family of five along side my father, mother, younger brother and younger sister. I am also in possession of one pet fish that is slowly aging and dying, and am also in possession of the memory of a former second pet fish, that was eaten by the surviving fish. Those are some facts about me.

	<h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
	<p>
		Some of my hobbies include playing video games, eating food, playing handball and staying inside. I enjoy playing handball and playing video games a lot, and is what I tend to spend a large portion of my time doing, even when I know full well it should be put towards more productive things that I do not do or accomplish nearly enough as I should be. Eating food is always nice for me even when I feel like I definitely should not be eating that much and should stop eating. Staying inside is nice for me, as I am not really and outdoors person. Staying inside where it is safe and suited to me is just more where my comfort zone lies, and is where I spend most of my time, even on school days.
<ul></ul>
		Interests I have include astronomy and space, as well as technology. Space has always fascinated me, and has always induced at least some sense of curiosity in me, to the point that I had dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist or an astronomer at one point. However now, I had decided to follow a more conceivable path for my life and one that would seem more likely for me to accomplish. New technologies that are being used to further society and humanity have made me think about the possibilities that we as people are subject to, and that all of our technologies have been created by other people. These are my interests, as these topics inspire curiosity and a sense of possibility in me and other people, with much more left to see.

	<h4>Goals & Aspirations</h4>
	<p> 
		Some of my goals include going to university, establishing a viable lifestyle for myself and my family, and perhaps persuing a discipline around medicine or another science. University has always been a goal of mine, having been heavily valuing my post-school education and thinking about what I wanted to do in the future. With these skills and factors, I wish to raise my family in the best possible environment for them, and give my family some room to move around in their life. I have always respected doctors and other people working in medicine and what they can do for ordinary people like us, and how smart they appear to normal people. These are my goals, as I believe that these things are able to set myself up to lead a happy life for myself and my family, and these are roles or positions that I have looked up to and respected since I was young. I believe I set these goals for myself because these things motivate me and make me enjoy my work a little bit more.
	<ul></ul>
		Some of my aspirations include working in medicine, being able to provide for my family comfortably in the future, and to lead a happy life for my family, including myself. Working in medicine ties in with my desires to become something like a doctor in the future, and is a role in society that I admire and respect. To be able to provide for my family is a standard desire that I believe many others have, and being able to lead a happy life for my family in the future ties in with my want to be able to provide for my family. I want my family to be happy in the future, and to be able to live comfortably within society. I aspire these things as these are things that make myself happy and give myself a sense of accomplishment that satisfies me. Simply put, these things are what I want to do because of how happy they make me feel with myself.
