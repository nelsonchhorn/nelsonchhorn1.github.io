		Sorry! This page is not finished yet. There is not any deliberate content available as of now on this page. This is due to the lack of submission on account of our part, or the fact that at the point in time when this assignment was completed, there were no further assessments to submit. This page is a work in progress as of now, but hopefully a copy of our second assessment task based around digital editing softwares for IST will be uploaded here. Stay tuned for our page to be featured with content soon!
